                        I am passionate about travel because I want to explore the world and try new things whether it's
                        a beach holiday with my family or another check mark off my bucket list. I also want to help
                        others achieve their dreams. Vacations are the only way to recharge and gain memories that last
                        a lifetime.
                        <br>
                        One of my greatest travel memories is hitting an open road and just exploring the local areas
                        while trying not to get completely lost.

                        My passion for travel really started after I became a travel agent and took my first trip in
                        1996. It was for four nights to The Bahamas staying at an all inclusive resort. I loved being on
                        a white sand beach surrounded by the beautiful blue sky and ocean with the breeze blowing
                        through my hair. I knew from that moment I was hooked.
                        <br>
                        One of my greatest travel memories is when I got married on the beach in Jamaica which is such a
                        beautiful island with lovely people.

                        I like being wrong. The biggest problem with today's predictive technology and social media is
                        that you only get to see what you already know and like. When you travel you run right into
                        people and things that you have already stereotyped and then you learn you are wrong. You learn
                        so much about people and you get to take that home with you and keep it all your life.
                        <br>
                        It seems my most vivid memories of travel are when something went wrong such as getting the
                        rental car stuck in the mud in Costa Rica; being in the worst hurricane in 100 years in Puerto
                        Vallarta; having to tip a police officer in Cancun to avoid a traffic ticket; and driving
                        through an ice storm in Oregon. If I had known any of this in advance, I still would have gone
                        on the trip. Some of it was scary at the time but the memories are awesome.
